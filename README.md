ðŸ“Š Customer Segmentation â€” K-Means Clustering
This project is part of an AI & ML Internship focused on unsupervised learning and clustering.

ðŸ“„ Objective
To perform customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering on the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.

ðŸ“‹ Steps:
1. Loaded the Mall Customers dataset using Pandas.
2. Displayed top rows and basic info using head() and info().
3. Checked for missing values and data types.
4. Dropped CustomerID and encoded Gender.
5. Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
6. Applied the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (K).
7. Trained K-Means model and assigned cluster labels.
8. Evaluated clustering quality using Silhouette Score.
9. Visualized clusters using:
10. 2D scatterplots with selected features
11. PCA-based plots for dimensionality reduction

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
